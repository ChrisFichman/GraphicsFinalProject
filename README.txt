Directions for using the program are available by pressing i

Additional notes:
The asteroids are generated randomly(size and location), so try running 
it multiple times. Also, changing the value of N, or spread in the hw7ChrisFichman.c 
file will change the number of asteroids and the scope of the field.

try typing: >make me_a_sandwich


Time spent on this assignment:
I spent most of my time(16 hours total) trying to optimize the program so 
that it wouldn't hang up. I know that it's a problem with the textures 
loading into my asteroid buffer (it keeps generating random numbers for
asteroid positions), but I don't know how to set all those values
without putting a loop in main.
